**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?** 

One of the most interesting topics covered this quarter has been learning about workforce scheduling in field service operations. I found it interesting because it connects data, real-world constraints, and human decision-making. It highlights how data science in business operations is not just about prediction or exploratory analysis, but also about considering fair resource allocation and real-world constraints.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.** 

For the Quarter 2 Project, I would like to investigate how mathematical optimization can be used to optimize service efficiency and technician workload equity for technician assignment. Specifically, I am interested in developing a real-world application, a scheduling tool with different optimization models, and potentially an LLM, to help schedulers assign workload efficiently. 

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?** 

A potential change I would make is to start testing several optimization scheduling models earlier in the process, and really think about what application and insight is valuable to the company.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?** 

In terms of application, I would be interested in incorporating model deployment and web development into our project. In terms of modeling, I would also like to explore different optimization techniques and compare them with linear programming or constraint programming.
